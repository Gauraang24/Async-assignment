# Asynchronous JavaScript Examples

This repository contains examples of asynchronous JavaScript programming using different techniques such as callbacks, promises, and async/await. Each example is implemented in a separate HTML file along with corresponding CSS and JavaScript files.

## Getting Started

To view the examples, simply open the HTML files in your web browser. You can navigate between different examples using the navigation bar provided in the index.html file.

### Callbacks

The `callbacks.html` file demonstrates the use of callbacks to handle asynchronous operations. It includes tasks such as simulating a delay and fetching data from an API using callbacks.

### Promises

The `promises.html` file showcases the use of promises for asynchronous programming. It includes tasks to fetch data from an API using promises and handle errors gracefully.

### Async/Await

The `async-await.html` file illustrates the use of async/await syntax for asynchronous programming. It includes tasks to fetch data from an API using async/await and handle errors in an elegant way.
